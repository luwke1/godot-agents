# godot-agents

## Project summary

### One-sentence description of the project

Reinforcement machine learning agents designed to complete a video game in the godot engine and a game to be used the next year.

### Additional information about the project

This project aims to introduce K-12 students to the concepts of Reinforcement Machine Learning (RML). Our team is tasked with designing an agent for the current draft game and providing supporting documentation for students, along with a feedback document for the results of a trial event in December. Each team member will also design a new game for the following year, exploring different genres to show the diverse range of RML agents. Through this, students will gain foundational knowledge on Machine Learning and AI, preparing them for future challenges in a technology-driven world.

We are planning on implenting two reinforcement learning algorithms that will be documented and used to solve a game in Godot
The first agent will utilize Monte Carlo techniques, and the second agent will use the REINFORCE Policy Gradient algorithm.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following software and libraries are installed on your machine:

### 1. Godot Game Engine
- **Version**: Godot 4.2 or higher
- [Download Godot](https://godotengine.org/download)
- Godot will serve as the platform where the agents interact with the game environment.

### 2. Python
- **Version**: Python 3.7 or higher
- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Python will be used to implement and test the reinforcement learning algorithms before integration with Godot.

### 3. TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Choose either [TensorFlow 2.x](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) or [PyTorch 1.x](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally) for building and training neural networks.
  
  - To install TensorFlow:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow
    ```
  - To install PyTorch:
    ```bash
    pip install torch
    ```


### Installation Steps

TODO: Describe the installation process (making sure you mention `bundle install`).
Instructions need to be such that a user can just copy/paste the commands to get things set up and running. 


## Functionality

TODO: Write usage instructions. Structuring it as a walkthrough can help structure this section,
and showcase your features.


## Known Problems

TODO: Describe any known issues, bugs, odd behaviors or code smells. 
Provide steps to reproduce the problem and/or name a file or a function where the problem lives.


## Additional Documentation

TODO: Provide links to additional documentation that may exist in the repo, e.g.,
  * Sprint reports
  * User links
