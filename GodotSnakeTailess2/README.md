This is a task in progress.  The version published in .zip form on Octover 12 2024
It is to create a game that contestants in Science Olympiad can enter the event called "Game Agent" .. 
... and they are tasked with creating a RML game agent that can beat the game. 

There are essentially two parts, or levels:

... part 1 is much like a 2d snake game, but the snake has no tail.

... ... collect enough "power nodules" to fuel your tank for part 2

... ... press "L" to launch your tank

... part 2 is much like a lunar lander game, in 3d. This part is not used. 

... ... the overall goal is to safely land the tank in the landing zone at a very slow speed. 

... ... as of 7/6 I have finally won the game as a human player.  Now, I will next attempt a function solution.  Then a RML solution ... I suspect that these solutinos will require me to change the input and output variables between the agent and the environment into some kind of "tuple" to be more easily doable by us newbies.  ... 

The SciOlyy Event Description will be in a second file on this git project. 

... ... in 10/1 the task has changed ... use an AI tool to help create the RML Agent. or two.
