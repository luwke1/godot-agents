There are only four  possible Actions:
move left
move right
jump and left = double-jump and small move left
jump and right = double-jump and small move right

The observable space in this \"game\" is broken into 22 possible squares.
This is so that the Q-table is not too large.  Currenlty 4x22 = 88 cells.
A Q-learning table is a function that has the actions listed across the top, 
and the squares of the observable space down the side.  Each cell in the
table is a possible state and action.  The epsilon-greedy function chooses
the best action from each observable state and action-choices. 
The Q-learning table  should stay under about 800 possible states  so 
that a normal computer can handle the load. 

Note that adding an enemy, or lengthening the level space, or another 
action such as \"shooting\", or adding levels, or increasing the number of 
\"coins\", etc,  each increases the Q-table size ... "

getting all  coins is GAME OVER and won !!
The rewards had to be tweaked a lot to get this to work right ... 
... see the code ... and mess with it to learn about all the variables.

The jump portion is the equavalent to a double-jump.  

Another timer is used to track the entire allowable 45 seconds, 
and allows each Action to take about 4 seconds.  This code  is 
most awkward, but works. Using the vector system requires
changes in the layout of hte game board ... consider doing that. 

The \"player\" class coordinates the Actions as the Agent runs the 
saved policy from  the Q- function and Q-table in \"tutorial_tester\"."
