## YouTube link of Sprint 4 Video (Make this video unlisted)
## What's New (User Facing)
* Added DQN agent to the original tutorial game
* modified the original game to include enemies
* modified the original game to include moving platforms
## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint we added a DQN agent to the original Godot tutorial game. 
Last semester we completed a DQN agent in Godot for the Daisy collection game 
so some of this code was reused. We have been modifying the agent hoping to 
improve its training and testing scores.
We also made two modifications to the original game which we will train DQN 
agents on during the next sprint. The first modification adds enemies to the
game that chase the player. If the player is able to collect all of the coins
before being touched by an enemy they win. However, if the enemy touches the 
player before they collect all the coins they lose.
The second modification involves moving platforms. In this version of the game
the player attempts to jump on moving platforms to reach the top of the environment
and collect a coin. The game continues until the coin is collected or the player
gives up.
