 * created first running agent on the tailless snake game

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Provide a one paragraph synposis of what your team accomplished this sprint. Don't repeat the "What's New" list of features. Instead, help the instructor understand how you went about the work described there, any barriers you overcame, and any significant learnings for your team.

## Unfinished Work
We didn't complete all the work we planned to do during this sprint because Duncan did not contribute.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * we created the first reinforcement learning agents on our game environments
  * we were able to modify the car racing environment to look more space-themed
  * Item x
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * improve the agent trained in the modified car racing environment (should turn around corners)
   * improve the modified environment to look more space-themed
   * Item x
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * increase training simulations and modify rewards to improve modified car racing agent
   * add stars to the background of car racing environment and make the car look more like a rocket
   * Item x
