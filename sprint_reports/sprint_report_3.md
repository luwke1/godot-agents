# Sprint 3 Report (11/6/2024 - 12/5/2024)

## What's New (User Facing)
- Developed **DQN Agent** in the Godot game.
- Implemented **PPO** and **Q-Learning algorithms**.
- Added **Save Training Progress** feature for RL agents.
- Integrated **Load Trained Data** functionality for seamless continuity.
- Delivered **comprehensive client documentation** for all RL agents.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During Sprint 3, the team focused on finalizing key features for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This involved completing the DQN Agent in Godot, implementing PPO and Q-Learning algorithms, and ensuring training progress could be saved and loaded efficiently. Challenges included debugging hyperparameter issues and ensuring compatibility between algorithms and environments. We also worked extensively on client-tailored documentation, ensuring all requirements were met.

## Unfinished Work
- A third RL agent (couldnt be completed since our third teammate Duncan did not contributed)

## Retrospective Summary
### What Went Well:
- Successfully implemented and debugged core RL algorithms (DQN, PPO, Q-Learning).
- Added save and load functionality to enhance usability.
- Delivered client-ready documentation for all RL agents.

### What Needs Improvement:
- Further optimization of the DQN agentâ€™s performance in challenging environments.
- Expand PPO integration to more complex tasks and refine training efficiency.

### Next Sprint Goals:
- Build two Python games that will enable students to implement reinforcement learning agents into it
- Our project client Ron is still unsure on some requirements, he will let us know early January.
